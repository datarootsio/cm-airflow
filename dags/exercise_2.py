# Use what you’ve learned in the previous slide to create an operator and a sensor
# Create an operator that bakes pizzas in batch (and doesn’t wait)
# Create a sensor that waits for these pizza to be baked
# Create a new DAG with these 2 operators operators
# Play around with the sensor parameters (poke_interval, mode, timeout)
# * Extra points: create a macro that checks if a pizza is baked.
# * Extra extra points: write tests for your operator/sensor
